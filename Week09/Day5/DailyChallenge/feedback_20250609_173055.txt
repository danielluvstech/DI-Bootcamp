suggestions for improvement:
- The `Video` class is well-structured and fulfills the requirements of creating a class with a constructor and a `watch()` method.
- The bonus part of creating and instantiating five `Video` objects from an array is implemented correctly using a suitable data structure (an array of objects).
- The code could benefit from more robust input validation (e.g., ensuring `time` is a non-negative number).
- Adding comments to explain the purpose of the array and the loop would improve readability.
- Consider using template literals for cleaner string concatenation in the `watch()` method.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code successfully creates the `Video` class with the specified constructor and `watch()` method, fulfilling requirements 1 and 2.
- It instantiates two `Video` objects and calls the `watch()` method for each, satisfying requirement 3 and 4.
- The bonus requirements (5 and 6) are not implemented.  The code should be extended to include an array to store data for five `Video` instances and then loop through the array to create and use those instances.
