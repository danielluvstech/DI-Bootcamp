suggestions for improvement:
- The script.js file is missing, making it impossible to assess the correctness of the code fully.  The provided HTML only loads an external script.  The solution should be included within the response.
- Add comments explaining the purpose of each section of code for improved readability.
- While the performance is good for this small dataset, consider using more efficient methods like `map` and `filter` for larger datasets instead of `forEach` to improve conciseness and readability.
Correctness: 80%

suggestions for improvement:
- The comments can be removed once the code is reviewed and deemed correct.  They are helpful for understanding the solution process, but clutter the final code.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names than `winners` and `totalScore`. For example, `highScoringPlayers` and `overallGameScore` would improve readability.
Correctness: 100%
