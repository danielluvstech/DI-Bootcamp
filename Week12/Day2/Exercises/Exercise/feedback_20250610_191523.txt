suggestions for improvement:
- Implement error handling for the case when the API request fails or returns an unexpected response.  Currently, only a loading message is displayed; a clear error message is needed (as shown in the project instructions).
- The `homeworld` data needs to be fetched separately as it's a URL, not directly included in the character data.  Add another `fetch` call within the `displayCharacterInfo` function to retrieve and display the homeworld name.
- Add input validation to prevent issues with unexpected API responses, such as missing fields.  Check if the API response properties exist before accessing them to prevent errors.
- Improve styling using CSS for better presentation; the current styling is minimal.

suggestions for improvement:
- Add error handling for the case where the API response is not JSON parsable.
- Improve styling and add loading animation as described in the instructions.
- Consider using a more descriptive variable name than `char` in the `displayCharacter` function.
- Add input validation to ensure that the random ID generated is within the valid range (1-83).  Currently, it's implicitly assumed the API returns a result for every number in that range.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only includes CSS; it lacks the HTML structure and JavaScript functionality to fetch and display Star Wars character data using the specified API.  The CSS is well-structured and readable.
- Implement the AJAX call using `fetch` or a similar method.  Handle loading and error states as specified in the instructions (loading icon and error message).
- Add proper error handling to gracefully manage API request failures.
- Include the button element in the HTML to trigger the data fetch and update.
