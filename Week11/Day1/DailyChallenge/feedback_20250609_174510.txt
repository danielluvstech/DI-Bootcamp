suggestions for improvement:
- The code uses GET instead of POST, which is less suitable for sending form data.  POST is generally preferred for forms submitting data.
- The JSON output is not properly formatted for readability.  It should use `JSON.stringify` with indentation for better presentation.
- Error handling is missing. The script should handle cases where the user doesn't fill in both fields.

suggestions for improvement:
- Add input type="text" to the form fields for better semantics and accessibility.
- Use more descriptive variable names (e.g., `firstNameInput` instead of `firstName`).
- Consider adding error handling (e.g., checking if the fields are empty before creating the JSON).
