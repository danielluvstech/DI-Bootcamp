The `package.json` file itself is correctly configured for a React project using Vite, React Router, and Bootstrap.
- Implement the ErrorBoundary component with componentDidCatch to handle errors in child components.
- Implement the React Router navigation and routes as specified in the instructions.
- Create the functional components `HomeScreen`, `ProfileScreen`, and `ShopScreen` with the appropriate content and error handling.
- Create the `PostList` component and implement JSON data rendering.
- Implement the `Example1`, `Example2`, and `Example3` components for parsing and displaying complex JSON data.
- Create an async/await function for posting JSON data using fetch and implement button functionality.
- Add thorough error handling throughout to account for potential issues (e.g., network errors, JSON parsing failures).
- Ensure that the `key` props are used correctly in the JSX to optimize rendering performance when working with lists.

- The `ShopScreen` component should ideally throw a specific error with a descriptive message rather than just a generic error. This helps with debugging and improving the user experience when an error is caught by the `ErrorBoundary`.
- Consider using a more descriptive path names in the `Routes` component (e.g., `/home`, `/profile`, `/products` instead of `/`, `/profile`, `/shop`) to improve clarity and maintainability.
- For Exercise 2 and 3, the code for `PostList`, `Example1`, `Example2`, and `Example3` components is missing.  The JSON parsing and rendering functionality is not evaluated in the context of the provided App.jsx.

It's a basic Vite setup for a React project, but it doesn't contain any React components, routing, error handling, or JSON data processing as required by the exercises.
- The exercises require creating React components, using React Router, implementing an ErrorBoundary, fetching and displaying JSON data, and making POST requests.  This Vite config does none of that.
