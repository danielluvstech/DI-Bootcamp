URL: URL: https://github.com/danielluvstech/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week21/DailyChallenge/validateUnionType.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The function uses `typeof` which has limitations.  For example, `typeof null` returns 'object', which might not be the intended behavior. Consider using a more robust type checking method, perhaps using `Object.prototype.toString.call(value)` for more precise type identification.  This would address the cases where `null` and arrays are incorrectly classified.
- Add TypeScript type annotations for better type safety and readability.  The current JavaScript code lacks type annotations, making it harder to maintain and understand.
Correctness: 90%

URL: URL: https://github.com/danielluvstech/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week21/DailyChallenge/validateUnionType.ts
suggestions for improvement:
- The function correctly uses `typeof` to check the type of the input value and the `includes` method to verify if it's present in the array of allowed types. However, it considers `null` and arrays as 'objects', which might not accurately reflect the intent if strict type checking is required.  Consider adding a more robust type checking mechanism or explicitly adding 'object' and 'null'  to the allowedTypes array if those are truly valid inputs.
- Add more comprehensive test cases to cover edge cases like `undefined`, `NaN`, `Symbol`, etc. and different array types.
