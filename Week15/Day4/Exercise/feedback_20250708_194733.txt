- The provided HTML file is a basic Vite + React setup. It does not contain any of the React components or logic described in the exercises.  The exercises require creating several components (`Car`, `Garage`, `Events`, `Phone`, `Color`), implementing event handlers, using state management (useState hook), and utilizing the component lifecycle (useEffect hook).  The provided HTML file only sets up the environment, but does not implement any of the described functionality.
- Add the necessary React components and logic based on the exercises' instructions.  This includes creating the components, implementing state management, and handling events as described in each exercise part.

- Exercise 2 (Events):  Implement the `Events` component, using functional components and the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, to handle the button click, key press, and toggle functionality.
- Exercise 4 (useEffect hook): Implement the `Color` component using the `useEffect` hook to change the color after a delay and on button click.  The current code lacks this component entirely.
